# Data science problem

This is a Binder compatible repo which contains a guided begginer level Data Science problem in the form of Jupyter notebooks. The problem is split in 2 tasks with a first task for data exploration and cleaning and the second task for data modeling and analysis. 

The notebooks are organised following the tweek, twiddle pedagogical pattern which scales to the learners coding level. 

The tasks are self explanatory and there is even a bynder intro that would help the learners be familiar with the binder environement before they  start working on the DS problem.

Each task should not take more than 30min to run through and the full solution is already provided as  the focus is more about learning the problem solving prosess rather than finding the right answer.

## Notes
The `requirements.txt` file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks
depend on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
